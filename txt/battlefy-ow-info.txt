Hello and welcome all participants of Overwatch cup.

This is a small guide with how to proceed with the tournament.

First of all please be sure to read all rules and try to understand them - https://esports.unicon.lv/games/overwatch not knowing them won't save you from obligation to follow them.
Second - sportsmanship is a must, behave properly. This is first huge tournament in Latvia in Overwatch discipline. So leave your trolling for your friends. Captains are responsible for their team members. Your whole team will be accounted if only 1 person try to misbehave.
Third - play fair. Cheating won't do any good and will be noticed.
Fourt - try to have a good time and strive to win!
Fifth - admins are there, contact them in case of need.

As you know because game is new, there are still not much teams. We decided to switch from Single elimination to Double elimination bracket. It is already available here https://battlefy.com/unicon-esports/unicon-esports-cup-2016-overwatch/575d6a9c3b2c00210c5ea8f0/stage/5776be82d2e5988b0c69b2af/bracket/
There you can find, do you already have an opponent or not.
Also on Battlefy page, where you previously saw "Registration/Check in" buttons. You will now see your active match. Click on it to see data about your match, data about your members, opponent members and there you also have "Privat chat" tab. Please use it to discuss with your opponent the details of the match.
We strongly advice you to use Private chat tab as our admins will be always able to see this chat or write in it if necessary. Consider it as official chat log of all your agreements and discussions with opponent team.

So, your match is ON. What to do next?
- You need to discuss with opponent captain when you're team are going to play.
- Remember, you have only next 3 days to play the game. So if your match started on 2nd of July, your game must be played until 5th of July. If it started on 7th it must be played until 10th (so on 7th, 8th, 9th).
- Write in private chat and wait for opponent team captain to respond. If you click "View rooster" you will find out who is the captain of enemy team quite easily.
- If you don't want to wait for opponent team captain to reply. You can add him to your battle.net as you know his battle tag. To tell, that you are online and ready to discuss
- After the date and time between your team and opponent team was decided and agreed, please drop a link for your match or just match number to Maxtream on discord - https://discord.gg/011uwa9mciv73Ci22. As we might decide to stream/record your game.

What to do if opponent captain is not using Private chat of Battlefy?
- We strongly advice you to use it. As chats in other places (Battle.net as well) usually get lost. And after you need to create bunch of screenshots that make more confusing and waste everyone time.

What to do if opponent not replying in Private battlefy chat and not adding me on battle.net
- Please try to add different people from opponent team and ask if they still plan to participate.
- Contact admins on discord chat, stating that opponent team captain is ignoring you.
- Please do bear in mind, that if team captain "ignoring" you for 20 minutes - it is not ignore. He might be offline, that why we give you 3 days. To try to please everyone.

What if we can't come to a conclusion about date and time? I want to play this Friday at 19:00 and opponent say he is only able to play this Sunday on 01:00.
- Don't panic, don't rage.
- Contact Maxtream on discord channel and this will be discussed between admins. In 3 days, there should be enough time to play one BO5 game.
- If there will be no agreement in the end between all parties. One team will have to go. This will be decided collectively by admins.

What if something bad happened? Like someone trolling and called me "noob".
- One thing is called emotions, sometimes it is allowed. If you're easily offended by "noob" that came once from one person in an emotions and got butthurt over those things, better disable the chat and let calm people discuss stuff. If this person constantly misbehaving, that is a different situation and not normal of course.
- If someone is being racist, xenophobic or behaving like a total prick - MAKE SCREENSHOTS. For this, team can be instantly disqualified.
- "ggeasy" is also an offense. But not offense to disqualify team instantly. But please do screenshot. If this team will do it twice, that does make the difference and might disqualify them.
- To not stress yourself and then tell that you lost because of someones pressure of calling you "noob" over and over. And you wasting time on replies. Make many screenshots, don't say anything and provide them to admins afterwards. You might get auto-win because you know how Sportsmanship works.

What if * happened and I don't think it's allowed?
- MAKE SCREENSHOT. We won't be able to do anything even if your whole team going to tell us that something happened. No evidence - no crime.

I have a question, what should I do?
- Use discord, we will always be there for you if you need assistance.

What should I do if I think players is cheating?
- Unfortunatelly there is not much you can do right now against it. Game is new and Blizzard developing anti-cheat features.
- Try to make a video if your PC allow it, where you can see strange things happening on Death Cam.
- Make sure to right click use and report him to Blizzard if you really believe he is cheating. Blizzard anti-cheat system ban user not only on this specific account. But will also prohibit user to play in the future, by banning his new "clean" accounts.
- There are not so many good cheats available, because the game is new. So it's quite unlikely.

Good luck.
